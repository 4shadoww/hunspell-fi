Finnish dictionary for hunspell
===============================

This is an incomplete Finnish dictionary for hunspell spell checker. It's not suitable for serious usage.

dic and aff files originate from myspell-fi Debian package, which is not widely available and can be found only from some archiving services.
The main reason for the existence of this git repository is to make this dictionary more available,
because it's still better to have incomplete spell checking than absolutely nothing.

These files are converted from ISO8859-1 encoding to UTF-8 to make this more compatible. Check copyright file for original authors.
